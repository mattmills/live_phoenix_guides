# LiveGuides

This is a version of the [phoenix guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/v0.14.0/docs) as an offline site, written in Phoenix. To start, clone this repo, clone the guides, and start the app.

```
git clone https://github.com/mattmills/live_phoenix_guides.git
cd live_phoenix_guides
git clone https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_guides.git
mix phoenix.server
```

I decided to make this when I was going on vacation, and needed something to do on the flight. I was going to do a little app in phoenix, and found out the guides didn't work offline. It's still a work in progress.
