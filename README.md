# LiveGuides

This is a version of the [phoenix guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/v0.14.0/docs) as an offline site, written in Phoenix. To start the guides, just clone this repo and start the app like you would any other:

```
mix phoenix.server
```

I decided to make this my second or third phoenix project when I was going on vacation, and needed something to do on the flight. I was going to do a little app in phoenix, and found out the guides didn't work offline.

It's entirely possible that they're behind the current guides, as the maintainers make updates constantly. In order to update, you can run these commands:

``` console
cd phoenix_guides # from the root of this repo
git pull origin master
```

People familiar with git and submodules will have figured this out already.
